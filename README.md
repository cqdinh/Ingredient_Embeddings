# Ingredient_Embeddings
An attempt to use the [Epicurious Recipe Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/hugodarwood/epirecipes) to learn embeddings for ingredients for use in predicting what ingredients go well together.

This project was originally for UMBC's Natual Language Processing course in Fall 2018 and my final report can be found in report.pdf
